Itâ€™s about Detecting the abnormal activity (i.e. anomaly) that happens around the day to live and alerting the people or doing the necessary steps if an anomaly occurs.
It also depends on the appearance of the objects and their movements in the scene. I used XGBoost Algorithm which means the Yolo model. It optimizes and learns video data. 
XGBoost, which stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library.
XGBoost is a robust machine-learning algorithm that can help you understand your data and make better decisions. In this model it has two types Violence and Non-Violence activity,
if any Violence activity has been done it predicts the output as an Abnormal event and if any Non-Violence activity has been done it predicts the output as a Normal event.
